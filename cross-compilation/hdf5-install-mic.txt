Download from:
    - hdf5 site - http://www.hdfgroup.org/
    - tested and hdf5-1.8.9 and 1.8.13


Build && Install:
    - install ZLIB and SZIP first
    - if it is necessary, load intel modules

        module load intel

    - you must build hdf5 for the host (build for Xeon Phi will fail after some time, you have to copy some source files from host build to mic build directory)
    - unpack hdf5 package
    - you can create for example directories "host" and "mic" with content of hdf5-1.8.9.tar.gz

        mkdir host
        mkdir mic

    - so you can start with host build, e.g.

        cd host
        ../configure --prefix=/path/to/hdf5-1.8.9/host/installed --enable-fortran --enable-cxx --enable-hl
        make

    - for the mic installation, you will have to edit (probably) following files:

        configure
            - find as_fn_error () functions, and delete (or make comment) line "as_fn_exit $as_status"

        src/H5private.h
            - replace "#define HDmkdir(S,M) mkdir(S,M)" with "#define HDmkdir(S,M) _mkdir(S)"

        tools/h5copy/Makefile.in
        tools/h5diff/Makefile.in
        tools/h5dump/Makefile.in
        tools/h5ls/Makefile.in
        tools/h5stat/Makefile.in
        tools/misc/Makefile.in
        test/Makefile.in
            - in this files, find lines starting with "TEST_SCRIPT = "
            - delete all characters after "=" character to end of line

    - then configure, e.g.

        cd ../mic
        ../configure --enable-hl --with-zlib=/path/to/zlib-1.2.8-mic --with-szlib=/path/to/szip-2.1-mic --prefix=/path/to/hdf5-1.8.9/mic/installed CC=icc CXX=icpc FC=ifort CFLAGS="-mmic" CXXFLAGS="-mmic" FCFLAGS="-mmic" --host=x86_64-k1om-linux
        make

    - after some time, installation will fail
    - you have to copy /path/to/hdf5-1.8.9/host/src/H5lib_settings.c to /path/to/hdf5-1.8.9/mic/src

        make

    - if installation fails again, copy /path/to/hdf5-1.8.9/host/src/H5Tinit.c to /path/to/hdf5-1.8.9/mic/src/src

        make

    - this will cause other errors like "other_broken_file.c:(.text+0x2c66): undefined reference to `_mkdir'"
        - 1.) you have to replace all occurrences of "HDmkdir" with "mkdir" in this file
        - 2.) make
        - if you get a similar error, go to step 1.)

    - if build was successful, install hdf5 lib

        make install

    - if you want to build hdf5-1.8.13, you have edit only configure script (maybe !)
